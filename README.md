## Syntax Highlighting

Plugin uses 'pygments'. It goes through each article before displaying them and wraps each code line with a span tag. All you need to do is wrap your snippet in a 'pre' tag with a 'lang' attribute and a 'code' tag.

Haml:

```
%pre
  %code(lang="objective-c")
    :plain
      -(void) ballinMethod;
```
